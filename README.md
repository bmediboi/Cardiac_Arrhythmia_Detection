# Cardiac Arrhythmia Detection

## Introduction

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It serves as a comprehensive resource for arrhythmia classification and detection.  
Access the dataset here: [UCI Arrhythmia Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).  

### Dataset Overview:
- **Total Examples:** 452 instances distributed across 16 distinct classes.  
- **Normal Cases:** Out of the 452 samples, **245** correspond to individuals classified as "normal."  
- **Arrhythmia Cases:** The remaining cases represent **12 different types of arrhythmias.**  
- **Key Arrhythmia Types:**  
  - **Coronary Artery Disease** – one of the most prevalent types.  
  - **Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB)** – another significant representation within the dataset.  

### Features and Attributes:
- **Total Features:** 279 attributes per patient.  
- **Demographic Information:** Age, sex, weight, and height are included.  
- **Medical Indicators:** The dataset comprises various vital measurements and test results crucial for arrhythmia detection.  

### Observations:
- **High Feature-to-Sample Ratio:** The dataset presents a **significant imbalance** between the number of features (279) and the number of examples (452). This high dimensionality can pose challenges in model training and may require dimensionality reduction or feature selection techniques.  

### Project Goal:
- **Primary Objective:** Predict whether an individual is suffering from cardiac arrhythmia.  
- **Secondary Objective:** If arrhythmia is detected, classify the case into one of the **12 arrhythmia types.**  

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of arrhythmia detection, contributing to enhanced diagnostic tools and early intervention strategies.

# Cardiac_Arrhythmia_Detection
### Introduction

The Dataset used in this project is available on the UCI machine learning Repository.
It can be found at: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).
  * It consists of 452 different examples spread over 16 classes. Of the 452 examples,245 are of "normal" people. 
  * We also have 12 different types of arrhythmias. Among all these types of arrhythmias, the most representative are the "coronary artery disease" and "Rjgbt boundle branch block". 
  * We have 279 features, which include age, sex, weight, height of patients and other related information. 
  * We explicitly observe that the number of features is relatively high compared to the number of examples we are available. 
  * Our goal was to predict if a person is suffering from arrhythmia or not, and if yes, classify it in to one of 12 available groups.
